#The Linux Command Line
##William E. Shotts, JR.

GUI: Graphical User Interface (is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation)
CLI: Command Line Interface ( is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines)).

Command line is equal to *shell*

A *Shell* take keyboard commands and passes them  aperating system to carry out.

A *shell prompt* is:
```  [me@linuxbox ~]$
```
And it appears whenever the shell is ready
to accept input.
